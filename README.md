# MLClassifierEvaluation

Repo containing some comparisons of weka classifiers to do stats on.

Uses the datasets from UCI, containing both discrete and continuous data. It can be downloaded [here](https://nc.eda.gay/s/iaCxxTWFHKXdBSw/download).

All classifiers use their default parameters. This is done for similicity, but bare in mind that the preformance of some trees and SVMs can be hugely improved by tuning parameters.
